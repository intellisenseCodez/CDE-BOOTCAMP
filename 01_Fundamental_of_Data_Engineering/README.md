# CoreHealthCare Data Pipeline Design

### Overview
This capstone project is designed to reinforce the understanding of the core components of an end-to-end data pipeline. The focus is on conceptualizing and designing a comprehensive data pipeline that addresses data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis. The project challenges apply theoretical knowledge to a practical scenario without the need to build or code the actual pipeline.

In this project i show case my knowledge on the fundamental of data engineering and designing data pipeline system base on some scenerio.
